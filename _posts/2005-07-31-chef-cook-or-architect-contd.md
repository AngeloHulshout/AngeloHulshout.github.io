I asked Gerrit Muller's opinion on the previous post - which, by the way, is
not yet reflecting my curiousity, I'll try rephrasing things a bit within the
next month or so.

Gerrit's reaction consisted of two remarks:

First of all, he thinks Gordon Ramsay (like Gerrit himself I guess) is beyond
the stage of senior chef/senior architect. He's grown to become a
consultant/trainer/advisor. Still, the parallel is very clear.

Second remark was that this parallel is similar to those that others have come
up with (I never had the intention to be original ;-) ). Examples of these are
comparisions of system/software architects with movie directors, composers,
conductors etc.

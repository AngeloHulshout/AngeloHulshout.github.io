Key to my work, and to the translated articles I'm publishing here is the TOP
model. I'll elaborate more on this later, but here's a short description of
the underlying idea of the model.

From experience, we know that human behaviour plays an important role in
software engineering - after all, we are still humans creating software. The
TOP model ( Technology, Organisation and Process) integrates these
observations into a consistent and pragmatic view on the discipline. The
delicate balance between three axes of the model determines the success of
development projects. All important decisions must be made with the balance
between the three axes in mind. The absence of synergy between technology,
organisation and process works like sand in an engine.

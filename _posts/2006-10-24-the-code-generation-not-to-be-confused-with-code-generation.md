Bill Gates had this to say in a 2005
[interview](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/09/15.html#a1302) with Jon
Udell:

is — do you write less code to get the same thing
done?](http://lesscode.org/2005/09/20/bill-gates)

An interesting statement, as we concluded today, from one of the top
representatives of 'the code generation' - that is, the generation of
developers that grew up handcoding everything. Actually, most of the people
that I encounter who could be considered part of that generation are the ones
objecting hardest to using any kind of modeling tool. This is part of the
culture change needed when switching from traditional development to model
driven software development. It's something that will come up in the [online
workshop idea](http://blog.hulshout.nl/archives/30-Defining-a-language.html)
I'm currently working on. Again, keep an eye out….
